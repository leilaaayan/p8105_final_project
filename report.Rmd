## Motivation 

Our project aims to address the critical public health challenge of HIV by understanding its distribution among racial groups in New York City. December 1, designated as World AIDS Day by the WHO, underscores the urgency of raising awareness and preventing the spread of HIV (HIV can progress to AIDS if left untreated). By identifying the most affected communities, we seek to uncover systemic issues like socioeconomic inequality and healthcare access disparities, guiding targeted interventions to reduce health inequities and promote social equity.
