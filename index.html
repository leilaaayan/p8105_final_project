<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the bodyâ€™s
immune system, specifically targeting CD4 cells (T cells), which are
crucial for fighting infections. If left untreated, HIV can weaken the
immune system over time, leading to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome), the most severe stage of the virus. HIV is primarily
transmitted through blood, semen, vaginal and rectal fluids, and breast
milk, often via unprotected sex, sharing needles, or mother-to-child
transmission during childbirth or breastfeeding. While there is no cure,
effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress the virus to
undetectable levels, preventing disease progression and reducing
transmission. With proper treatment and preventive measures like PrEP,
HIV is now a manageable chronic condition, allowing individuals to live
long, healthy lives.</p>
<p><img src="images/hiv.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>UHF (United Hospital Fund) areas are geographic regions used in New
York City for public health research and planning. These areas were
defined by the United Hospital Fund of New York to align neighborhoods
with population-based health care planning and analysis. The dataset of
HIV diagnoses are collected based on UHF areas consisting of clusters of
adjacent ZIP codes.</p>
<p>Understanding the distribution of HIV among racial groups in
different areas of New York City is crucial for addressing health
disparities and promoting social equity. Differences in HIV rates across
racial and geographic lines often highlight deeper issues, such as
socioeconomic inequality, limited access to healthcare, and systemic
discrimination. By identifying the most affected communities, this
research provides valuable insights for designing targeted prevention
and treatment strategies that meet the specific needs of high-risk
populations. Ultimately, these efforts aim to reduce health inequities
and improve public health outcomes throughout the city.</p>
