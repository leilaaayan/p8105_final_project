##### Tentative project title:

The impact of air quality on respiratory illnesses in NYC

##### Motivation for this project:

Since arriving in New York for school, I have experienced recurring
symptoms of rhinitis. This persistent discomfort has led me to suspect
that the city’s air quality may be a contributing factor. I see this as
an opportunity to conduct research on New York City’s air quality,
aiming to understand how it may impact respiratory health and to provide
insights that could contribute to better public health outcomes.

##### Intended final products:

We intended to create a website to report our findings.

##### Anticipated data sources:

- NYC Open Data
- DOHMH

##### Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:

###### Planned analyses

- Seasonal trends: analyze seasonal variations in pollutant levels and
  respiratory symptoms
- Geospatial analysis: create maps to visualize air quality levels and
  respiratory health outcomes by area

###### Visualization

- PM 2.5 mapping: display PM2.5 concentrations across different areas in
  NYC, highlighting pollution hotspots and spatial patterns that impact
  respiratory health.
- Line graph: Show trends in PM2.5 levels and respiratory illness cases
  over time, allowing for easy comparison of seasonal and daily
  fluctuations in both variables.

###### Challenges

- Missing data/incomplete data entries for a specific borough
- Multiple data sources: Air quality and health data come from multiple
  sources like government agencies, monitoring stations, and hospitals.
  Integrating these requires careful matching of location and time
  variables, adding complexity.

##### Planned timeline:

- Nov. 11-15: Data collection and preprocessing cleaning
- Nov. 16-30: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), perform R coding and
  analyses
- Dec. 1-7: Report + website + screencast + peer assessment
- Dec. 8-12: Finalize + wrap up
